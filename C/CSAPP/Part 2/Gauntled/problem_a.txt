 Homework Problems
 2.55 ◆
 Compile and run the sample code that uses show_bytes (file show-bytes.c)on
 different machines to which you have access. Determine the byte orderings used
 by these machines.
 2.56 ◆
 Try running the code for show_bytes for different sample values.
 2.57 ◆
 Write procedures show_short, show_long, and show_double that print the byte
 representations of C objects of types short, long, and double, respectively. Try
 these out on several machines.
 2.58 ◆◆
 Write a procedure is_little_endian that will return 1 when compiled and run
 on a little-endian machine, and will return 0 when compiled and run on a big
endian machine. This program should run on any machine, regardless of its word
 size.

 Suppose wenumberthebytesinaw-bitwordfrom0(leastsignificant) to w/8−1
 (most significant). Write code for the following C function, which will return an
 unsigned value in which byte i of argument x has been replaced by byte b:
 unsigned replace_byte (unsigned x, int i, unsigned char b);
 Here are some examples showing how the function should work:
 replace_byte(0x12345678, 2, 0xAB)--> 0x12AB5678
 replace_byte(0x12345678, 0, 0xAB)--> 0x123456AB
